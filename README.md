# Econet-BackEnd

This repository contains the backend implementation of a web application built using TypeScript, Node.js, and NestJS. The application provides a RESTful API for accessing and manipulating data stored in a MongoDB database.

The backend is built using the NestJS framework, which provides a powerful set of tools and features for building scalable and modular applications. The application is designed using a layered architecture, with clear separation between the business logic, data access layer, and presentation layer.

The project is organized into modules, with each module representing a distinct area of functionality. The application provides a comprehensive set of endpoints for managing users, authentication, and various data entities.

The code is written in TypeScript, which provides strong typing and helps catch errors at compile time. The project also leverages the latest features of Node.js, including async/await and the latest ECMAScript standards.

The project is designed to be highly scalable and easily extensible, with a clean and modular architecture that allows for easy integration with other systems.
