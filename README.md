# Econet-BackEnd

This is our first NestJS project.
This repository contains the backend implementation of a web application built using TypeScript, Node.js, and NestJS. The application provides a RESTful API for accessing and manipulating data stored in a MongoDB database.

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository
2. Navigate to the project repo `cd BackEnd-Econet/econet_backend`
3. Get the required packages `npm install`
4. Create a `.env` file and complete it with `DB_URL=YOUR_MONGODB_URL` using your MongoDB url
5. Run the application : `npm run start`

## Note
- The app is designed to be highly scalable and easily extensible, with a clean and modular architecture that allows for easy integration with other systems
- The interface we built is available [here](https://github.com/guilhem-cros/Econet_FrontEnd)
- For more information about NestJS applications, see the [NestJS Documentation](https://docs.nestjs.com/)
